# RailsLite
This project is a framework for generating a backend server with relational database and basic request/response features.

## About RailsLite
RailsLite is a framework built in Ruby and inspired by, surprising though it may seem, the Rails framework developed by DHH. The core functionality is established in two main portions of the library. One chunk is dedicated to dealing with database querying and translating query results into Ruby objects in a manner reminiscent of Rails' ActiveRecord class. The other portion essentially implements the controller and view portions of the Rails MVC architecture. Rack middleware and ERB are integrated into the project to enable simple HTTP request processing and dynamic view generation.
